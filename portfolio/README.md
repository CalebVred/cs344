# Goal

These notebooks will demonstrate proficiency in basic machine learning concepts and skills. They will develop throughout the semester.

We aim that each notebook will:

* Demonstrate a single concept
* Take less than 15 minutes to complete, if that concept is understood
* Take less than 5 minutes to run to completion
* Be a useful reference for how to perform that operation in the future.

We also strive for the sequence to make sense, but make no promises.

# Index

* `000-train-basic-classifier`: fine-tune a ResNet classifier on the Oxford pets dataset.
* `001-adjust-hyperparameters-1`: change some basic hyperparameters of notebook 000
* `002-diagnose-basic-classifier`: plot a confusion matrix, find images that were misclassified
* `003-pets-dataloader`: create data loaders for the Pets dataset using the mid-level `DataBlocks` API
* `004-jsonlines`: pull data from newline-delimited JSON (and use list and dict comprehensions to work with it)
* `005-image-ops`: perform broadcast and reduction operations on a tensor representing a batch of color images
