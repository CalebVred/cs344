## Schedule

Overall, we will go through the first half of the Deep Learning for Coders book
at the pace that works for us, then see where we are. Then we will plan together
what remaining topics to discuss, such as:

* language processing (my specific area of interest), especially Transformers
* reinforcement learning
* unsupervised learning
* others as we identify them





### Homework 1

**Not yet assigned**

Build and evaluate a classifier to determine if a photo is taken of the inside
vs outside of a restaurant. Don't scrape photos; use the Yelp Academic Dataset.
