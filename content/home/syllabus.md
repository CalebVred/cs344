This is a course on developing AI systems using machine learning, with a particular emphasis on deep neural networks.

## Objective

By the end of this course, you will demonstrate growth in your ability to:

-   *Design, implement,* and *analyze* some state-of-the-art types of data-fueled intelligent systems
-   *Design* and *analyze* how these intelligent systems relate with people, individually and collectively, through a Reformed Christian lens.
-   Communicate the above with peers and members of the general public

## Philosophy

Our teaching philosophy is analogous to how both classical AI (planning) and modern machine learning systems (backpropagation) work: start at the end, work backwards, and iterate. So rather than starting with mathematical fundamentals, we will start by doing

The course may look quite different from other courses that you have taken. Trust me that this will still work---and even if it doesn't, you will still learn a lot if you put in the effort.

Accordingly, the final deliverable in this course will be a document that states what grade you think your work in this course merits, a succinct argument for why, and a portfolio of evidence that supports your argument. Your argument will be based on demonstration of:

-   A sustained effort throughout the semester ("cramming" is ineffective for retention)

    -   Weekly learning journal

    -   Regular completion of at-home and in-class activities

-   A semester project that demonstrates depth in implementing and analyzing an intelligent technology (see Project below)

-   Contribution to peers' learning

### Typical Weekly Schedule

-   *Preparation*: a reading and a video lecture. A short quiz (graded very leniently) will assess this

-   *Lab*: reproducing a book chapter and making small, guided extensions

-   *Homework*: applying a technique or concept in a new area

-   *Quiz*: a short check-in of what you've learned

-   *Discussion*: participate in a class-wide discussion forum; summarize your perspective in a portfolio piece

-   *Journal*: a summary of your learning this week (private to you and the course staff) *due Monday at class time*

In the final weeks of the semester, project work will replace many of these elements.

Lab, homework, and projects will generally be completed in pairs of your choice.
