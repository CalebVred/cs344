This is a course on developing AI systems using machine learning, with a particular emphasis on deep neural networks.

## Objective

By the end of this course, you will demonstrate growth in your ability to:

-   *Design, implement,* and *analyze* some state-of-the-art types of data-fueled intelligent systems
-   *Design* and *analyze* how these intelligent systems relate with people, individually and collectively, through a Reformed Christian lens.
-   Communicate the above with peers and members of the general public
-   Contribute to a team that learns: identify what you need to learn, reflect on your own learning, and help others learn

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with computer science concepts at the level of CS 212 will be generally expected. Beyond that, students should come to this course with some (perhaps rusty) ability to:

-   Read and write Python code (or be willing to invest significant energy the first few weeks picking it up)
-   Think systematically, generate and test hypotheses to explain observations, and communicate that thinking precisely.
-   Manage time, individually and in small groups
-   Collaborate to solve problems

## Materials

-   We will be following the fast.ai [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course for much of this course.

    -   You should buy their book (available in the Calvin bookstore), although it's also available as Jupyter Notebooks
    -   [Videos](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)
    -   their [forum](https://forums.fast.ai/c/part1-v4/46)

-   We will be using Piazza for class discussion. Many students have found that Piazza works well for getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Find our class signup link at: <https://piazza.com/calvin/spring2021/cs344>

## Grading

Your final grade will be computed as the weighted average of your grade in each of 3 categories, representing each of the primary learning outcomes of the course:

-   **Technology** (50%): You demonstrated the newly learned ability to design, implement, analyze, debug, or understand something significant.

-   **Comm (**Communication or Community, depending on the week) (25%): You contributed to other students' learning. e.g., *asked or answered questions in class / on Piazza / informally, gave constructive peer feedback, contributed to a class forum)*

-   **Context** (25%): You engaged with broader perspectives on AI. e.g., its current or future impacts on individuals, organizations, societies, the environment, etc., or questions about how AI and Christian faith relate, etc.

Each week (including exam week) you will turn in a reflection on your work and learning for the past week. In it, you will suggest a numeric grade for each of the 3 categories. (I reserve the right to deviate from your suggested grade.) Your grade for each category will be the average of each of the 14 grades in that category.

There will be weeks for which the structured content of the course does not give you a chance to sufficiently demonstrate learning in a given area. In such cases, you should proactively seek a learning opportunity in that category. I will provide some general resources; please ask for specific advice as needed. You may also simply take a 0 in that category that week; the lowest two grades in each category will be dropped.

## Philosophy

Our teaching philosophy is analogous to how both classical AI (planning) and modern machine learning systems (backpropagation) work: start at the end, work backwards, and iterate. So rather than starting with mathematical fundamentals, we will start by doing.

The course may look quite different from other courses that you have taken. Trust me that this will still work---and even if it doesn't, you will still learn a lot if you put in the effort.

Accordingly, the final deliverable in this course will be a document that states what grade you think your work in this course merits, a succinct argument for why, and a portfolio of evidence that supports your argument. Your argument will be based on demonstration of:

-   A sustained effort throughout the semester ("cramming" is ineffective for retention)

    -   Weekly learning reflections

    -   Regular completion of at-home and in-class activities

-   A semester project that demonstrates depth in implementing and analyzing an intelligent technology (see Project below)

-   Contribution to peers' learning

### Typical Weekly Schedule

-   *Preparation*: a reading and a video lecture. A short quiz (graded very leniently) due Monday at class time will assess this

-   *Lab*: reproducing a book chapter and making small, guided extensions

-   *Homework*: applying a technique or concept in a new area

-   *Quiz*: a short check-in of what you've learned

-   *Discussion*: participate in a class-wide discussion forum; summarize your perspective in a portfolio piece. Most discussions will be case studies on specific technologies, focusing on:

    -   How does it work?
    -   What impact does it have?
    -   How can we constructively assess it (generally, but not always, from a reformed Christian viewpoint)?

-   *Reflection*: a summary of your learning the past week (private to you and the course staff) *due Tuesday end of day*

    -   Reflections are structured according to the three primary areas discussed in Grading above

    -   Each reflection should include what has gone well for your progress in that area (refer to specific evidence), what difficulties you are still facing, and what you want to keep doing or change.

In the final weeks of the semester, project work will replace many of these elements.

### Weekly Structure

A week will frequently look like:

-   Monday: *in lab*. Go through an activity closely based on the textbook
-   Wednesday in classroom: debrief and Q&A about the reading / lab; discussion about an AI application or perspective
-   Friday *in lab*: working on homework
