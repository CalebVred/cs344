This is a course on developing AI systems using machine learning, with a particular emphasis on deep neural networks.

## Objective

By the end of this course, you will demonstrate growth in your ability to:

-   *Design, implement,* and *analyze* some state-of-the-art types of data-fueled intelligent systems
-   *Design* and *analyze* how these intelligent systems relate with people, individually and collectively, through a Reformed Christian lens.
-   Communicate the above with peers and members of the general public

## Philosophy

Our teaching philosophy is analogous to how both classical AI (planning) and modern machine learning systems (backpropagation) work: start at the end, work backwards, and iterate. So rather than starting with mathematical fundamentals, we will start by doing

The course may look quite different from other courses that you have taken. Trust me that this will still work---and even if it doesn't, you will still learn a lot if you put in the effort.

Accordingly, the final deliverable in this course will be a document that states what grade you think your work in this course merits, a succinct argument for why, and a portfolio of evidence that supports your argument. Your argument will be based on demonstration of:

-   A sustained effort throughout the semester ("cramming" is ineffective for retention)

    -   Weekly learning journal

    -   Regular completion of at-home and in-class activities

-   A semester project that demonstrates depth in implementing and analyzing an intelligent technology (see Project below)

-   Contribution to peers' learning

### Typical Weekly Schedule

-   *Preparation*: a reading and a video lecture. A short quiz (graded very leniently) due Monday at class time will assess this

-   *Lab*: reproducing a book chapter and making small, guided extensions

-   *Homework*: applying a technique or concept in a new area

-   *Quiz*: a short check-in of what you've learned

-   *Discussion*: participate in a class-wide discussion forum; summarize your perspective in a portfolio piece. Most discussions will be case studies on specific technologies, focusing on:

    -   How does it work?
    -   What impact does it have?
    -   How can we constructively assess it (generally, but not always, from a reformed Christian viewpoint)?

-   *Journal*: a summary of your learning the past week (private to you and the course staff) *due Monday end of day*

In the final weeks of the semester, project work will replace many of these elements.

### Journals

Rubric (supply evidence)

-   25%: I can do something that I couldn't do last week. State what it is and what evidence you have that you can do it.

-   25%: I can explain something that I couldn't explain last week. State what it is and give a quick example.

-   25%: I contributed to someone else's learning this week. (Asked / answered questions in class / on Piazza / informally, gave constructive peer feedback, contributed to a class forum)

-   25%: I engaged with AI in the world

Lab, homework, and projects will generally be completed in pairs of your choice.
