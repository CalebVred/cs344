## Semester Project

This course will culminate in a semester project. Successful projects will demonstrate
proficiency in all of the main course learning objectives:

* You'll design, implement, and/or analyze an intelligent system
* You'll communicate your work in both technical and non-technical terms
* You'll consider broader perspectives on your project.

Projects should generally be done in pairs, though allowances may be made on request.

Kinds of final projects (propose options of at least 2 different types):

- replicate, critique, and extend (part of) a published work
- apply an existing approach to a new dataset or task
- write a thorough explainer about a topic beyond the scope of the course and teach it to the class
- create an interactive application - using a model to do something interesting (e.g., ganpaint), or allowing interesting exploration / interaction with the model itself (e.g., lstmvis)
