## Goal

In this assignment, you will train and evaluate your own image classifier using `fastai`.

## Instructions

Pick two buildings on campus. Make a classifier that distinguishes photos of one from photos of the other.

- Take your own photos; don't use photos from the Internet.
- Please avoid recognizable images of people.

You will need to organize your photos into a dataset. I suggest:

- Name photos like `NorthHall_3.jpg`.
- Place all your photos in a folder for each building. So an image will actually be at `NorthHall/NorthHall_3.jpg`. (This way it's easy to rename buildings.)
- Use the approach from Chapter 2 to make a classifier based on these images.

Submit a Jupyter Notebook reporting your findings on Moodle. In addition to the code needed, include answers to these questions:

- How accurate is your classifier? Report your answer as a *range* (lower to upper) of expected accuracy values.
- How many images do you need to get good accuracy? (Try your classifier on fewer images.)
- What choices did you have to make in the process of collecting data, processing it, and analyzing the results?
  - What are one or two choices that you could have made differently?
  - What do you expect would be different if you made that different choice?

## Full-Class Dataset

Please contribute your photos to [this folder in our class Team](https://calvincollege.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/Section_81629/EpapLK3FkZlBm-AQutdecNEB8U9a6SXGDXEEGcFnTJ5YwA?e=FK6vVj). Make a new folder with your userid. Upload your two folders into it. (Drag and drop should work.)
