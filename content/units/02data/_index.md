Students who complete this unit will demonstrate that they can:

- Describe the structure of data fed to an image classifier
- Contrast a training set and validation set; explain appropriate uses of both
- Write Python code to prepare a dataset for an image classifier.
- Identify ethical issues pertaining to the collection and use of data in AI systems
- Implement multidimensional numerical computing operations using NumPy (or PyTorch)

Materials

- Read {{< fastbook num="2" nbname="02_production.ipynb" >}}
    - *note: ignore the implementation of `class DataLoaders`*.
    - Use duckduckgo instead of Bing.
- Read {{< fastbook num="3" nbname="03_ethics.ipynb" >}}
- Watch {{< fastvideo num="2" >}}


Activities
- Lab 2: basic fast.ai classifier
    - maybe also: wrangling practice, tensor practice (some early Fundamentals)
    - Review working with files in Python
    - List comprehensions etc.
- Homework 1: wrangle your own dataset (demonstrates that you understand the structure of an image dataset)

Discussion Forum:

- who has data on you? how much? what do you feel about that?

Midterm project milestone: summarize existing results, generate questions
