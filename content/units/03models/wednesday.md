title: "Wednesday class: Discussion, Model Evaluation, Loss Functions"
date: 2022-01-26
---

Plan:

- Discuss highlights from facial recognition [discussion forum](../discussion/) -- come prepared with insights from others' posts
- Opportunity: class blog
- Intro to AI Tech Questions
- How to evaluate a classifier? Accuracy and confusion matrices
- *time permitting* loss functions and the importance of partial credit

Examples:

- If the classifier was actually just looking at the first letter of the image filename, it could get 100% accuracy but it wouldn't actually be learning to recognize images.
