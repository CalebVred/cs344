## General

- Use Markdown cells to narrate what you're doing.

## Homework 2

- Burst photos: what effect would that have?
- Accuracy numbers: why might we see the exact same accuracy number from several trials?
- Include stats about your dataset, e.g., how many photos total?
- When you're using a smaller dataset, you're probably also using a smaller *validation* set. What does that do to your accuracy numbers?
