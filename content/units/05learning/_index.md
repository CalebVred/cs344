Students who complete this unit will demonstrate that they can:

- Contrast sensible vs non-sensible sequences of model layers (e.g., alternating linear and nonlinear)
- Describe and compute cross-entropy loss
- Implement a logistic regression model from fundamentals

<!-- - Activities
	- pets dataloader lab
	- softmax fundamentals 1 and 2
	- some variation on Learning Proportions lab? ^^bandit learning^^: how likely is each arm to give a payout? -->

## Preparation

The author's videos are a bit disorganized here, sorry about that.

- Read {{< fastbook num="5" nbname="05_pet_breeds.ipynb" >}}.
  - skip Presizing and LR finder
  - skim "discriminative" rates (which would better be called "layer-dependent learning rates")
  - Watch {{< fastvideo num="4" >}} (starting about 1 hr in) and {{<fastvideo num="6">}} (first half hour) for this material.
- Skim {{<fastbook num="6" nbname="06_multicat.ipynb">}}.
  - Watch {{<fastvideo num="6">}} from 30m to 1h30m for this material.

Activities:

- linear regression from scratch
