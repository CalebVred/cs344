<!-- next year this could be Lab 3, and Lab 4 could do a multilinear regression -->

- Implement single linear regression manually and calculate MSE
- Estimate the gradient numerically, by hand and then in code.
- Explain why the gradient for one parameter may initially seem to go in the wrong direction.
- Contrast the effects of gradient *ascent* and gradient *descent*.
- Descend the estimated gradient until convergence.
