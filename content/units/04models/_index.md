Students who complete this unit will demonstrate that they can:

- Describe the basic structure of a machine learning model.
- Describe the overall approach of Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Describe the parameters and operation of a linear layer.
- Describe the difference between a metric and a loss function.
- Identify the following loss functions: Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Difference, and Cross-Entropy. <!-- - Contrast sensible vs non-sensible sequences of model layers (e.g., alternating linear and nonlinear) -->
- Implement a basic image classifier model using a fully-connected network.
- Compute the gradients of programs with respect to parameters using one level of backpropagation
