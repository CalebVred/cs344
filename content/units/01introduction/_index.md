Students who complete this unit will demonstrate that they can:

- Identify some of the major milestones in the history of AI.
- Contrast contemporary ML-based and numerical AI with classical rule-based and symbolic AI
- Describe how modern machine learning uses data to learn parameters for a program
- Implement basic numerical computing operations using NumPy
- Implement a simple image classifier on a pre-wrangled dataset using fast.ai.

 Materials

- DL4C ch1, lesson 1 video
- Supplemental: MIT course video

Assignments:
- Lab 0 - Warmup
    - Introduction to array computing
    - Applying NumPy operations (elementwise, dot products)
    - Writing functions
        - Write the linear-projection function: assert dimensions compatible, do multiply+add
        - Get comfortable with functions
- Lab 1 - basic fast.ai classifier with variations
- Homework 1: Computing warm-up

Discussion Forum:

- identify AI examples
- what's intelligent about it?
- what resources were needed to make it?
