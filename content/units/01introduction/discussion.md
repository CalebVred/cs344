title: "Discussion 1: Examples of AI"
date: 2022-01-12

This week we are getting introduced to some history and application of AI. To help understand the landscape of AI and also get introduced to each other, let's survey some examples that students find interesting.

In this week's Discussion forum, please post a brief (50--200 word) statement where you:

- Give an example of an application of AI that you find interesting. Include an image of the system in action, or a link to something that describes it.
- Describe what about its behavior seems "intelligent" to you.
- How might that intelligent behavior have come about? Was it some simple rules and lots of computation (like the search algorithms you studied in 212)? Or perhaps was expert knowledge encoded explicitly in the program? Or was the behavior somehow learned from data---and if so, what data might that have been?

Also read your peers' posts and try to reply to a few.
