## Running Code

### Google Colab

In addition to the lab computers, you can run all the book's notebooks, and most of our labs and homeworks, on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

To install fastai, insert a cell at the top that contains:

```python
!pip install -Uq fastbook
from fastbook import *
```

(In the past it was also necessary to install `torchtext==0.8.1`. I suspect this is no longer required but I have not tested that.)

Tips:
- [intro](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), [overview](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)
-   Press Ctrl-Shift-P to open the Command Palette. Lots of useful stuff there; try the "scratch code cell".
-   Click the down arrow next to the RAM/Disk meter in the toolbar (where it used to say "Connect") and select "show executed code history".

### Jupyter Notebook

-   [Appendix](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/app_jupyter.ipynb) from our book

## Materials

-   Our book: [Deep Learning for Coders](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/)
    -   [Source notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook), [Arnold's cleaned notebooks](https://github.com/kcarnold/fastbook/tree/master/clean). Suggestion: use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (or Colab) when reading the notebooks, rather than GitHub.
