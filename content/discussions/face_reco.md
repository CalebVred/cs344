## Quote

> Facial recognition technologies pose complex ethical and technical challenges. Neglecting to unpack this complexity- to measure it, analyze it and then articulate it to others -is a disservice to those, including ourselves, who are most impacted by its careless deployment.

## Background

### What is it

Classification of face images to identify specific people or to predict attributes such as gender.

### Uses

- labeling people in social media images
- finding people in a crowd (identifying suspects in crimes, missing children)
- identifying customers (for airline boarding, touchless checkout, etc.)
- unlocking devices

### Potential concerns

- Inaccurate especially for minorities
  - [**GenderShades**](http://gendershades.org/index.html) summary video
  - Hill, K. (2020, July 24). [**Wrongfully Accused By an Algorithm**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html). The New York Times.
- Privacy and surveillance

### News

- Some cities have banned facial recognition
- [An Update On Our Use of Face Recognition | Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/): "Weâ€™re shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook."

## Provocations

- Are some uses bad? (predicting [likelihood to commit a crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/facial-recognition-race.html)? identifying political dissenters?)
- How to balance privacy with safety (e.g., identifying missing children)?
- How might facial recognition be re-imagined for good?
