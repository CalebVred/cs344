title: "Discussions"
---

The class includes weekly class-wide discussion forums (primarily on Moodle, some discussion in person). Most discussions will be case studies on specific technologies. We'll address three basic questions:

1. How does it work?
    - How does it use technologies that we've studied in class?
    - How does it go beyond what we've studied?
2. What impact does it have?
    - What people and relationships are affected by it?
    - What resources does it need? What resources does it produce?
    - What value does it produce for an organization that uses it?
    - Besides its primary use, what are other consequences of its deployment? (Consider both inside and outside an organization.)
3. How can we constructively assess it from a Reformed Christian perspective and other perspectives?
    - What ways of looking at or thinking about people does it emphasize? De-emphasize?
    - What are its main limitations?

These are far from the only useful questions. Other questions to ask might be:

- Neil Postman's [Five Things We Need to Know about Technological Change](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/references/postman-fiveThings-1998.pdf)
- L.M. Sacasas expanded them to [41 questions concerning technology](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-questions-concerning-technology)
