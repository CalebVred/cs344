title: "Discussions"

The class includes weekly class-wide discussion forums (primarily on Moodle, some discussion in person). Most discussions will be case studies on specific technologies.

## Instructions

Each week we'll choose a different technology (or sometimes another type of question). See the "Contents" below for the list; specific links will be given each week.

- Choose an applicable question.
  - Usually you'll choose one the general questions that we'll be asking about all technologies (see below).
  - Sometimes you might want to respond more directly to one of the provocative questions or issues given in the specific prompt.
- Write a short post (100-200 words) with your answer. Cite sources to support your views. The topic page will often give additional references that you may refer to.
  - Title your post with a summary of your answer.
  - Post it in the discussion forum for the corresponding week.
- Respond to one other student's post.

## Questions about Technologies

We'll focus our discussion on these questions:

1. How does it work?
    - How does it use technologies that we've studied in class?
    - How does it go beyond what we've studied?
2. What impact does it have?
    - What people and relationships are affected by it?
    - What resources does it need? What resources does it produce?
    - What value does it produce for an organization that uses it?
    - Besides its primary use, what are other consequences of its deployment? (Consider both inside and outside an organization.)
3. How can we constructively assess it from a Reformed Christian perspective and other perspectives?
    - What ways of looking at or thinking about people does it emphasize? De-emphasize?
    - What are its main limitations?
    - How might God redeem it in the New Creation?
    - How should we relate to it now---as individuals and as neighbors?

These are far from the only useful questions. Other questions to ask might be:

- Neil Postman's [Five Things We Need to Know about Technological Change](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/references/postman-fiveThings-1998.pdf)
- L.M. Sacasas expanded them to [41 questions concerning technology](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-questions-concerning-technology)

You might also pose a question of your own!
