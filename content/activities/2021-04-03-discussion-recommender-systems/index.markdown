We will discuss the effects of algorithmic recommendation systems on people. As usual, you should post on Moodle and be prepared to raise aspects of your own or others' posts during our in-class discussion.

### Discussion Post

You may choose to respond to one of our general discussion questions (see Resources on the website). You may also simply share any *thoughts*, *questions*, or *realizations* from your reading.
