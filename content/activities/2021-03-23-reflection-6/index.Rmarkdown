*This assignment should be turned in on Moodle. Note: released late, so due date postponed a bit.*

This reflection is similar in format to Reflection 5 but more flexible. You are, as always, welcome to make a compelling, argument for computing grades for yourself differently from this suggestion.

### Technology: \_\_\_%

Fill in the following list (specific instructions are below the list):

-   Reading: \[\_\_%\] *comments*

    -   Active Reading chapter 6:

    -   Active Reading chapter 8:

    -   Reading Quiz 5 (Cumulative):

-   Lab 3: \[\_\_%\] *comments*

    -   Before reviewing the walkthrough (preparation and strategies):

    -   After reviewing the walkthrough (reflection and takeaways):

-   Portfolio Fundamentals: \[\_\_%\]

#### Specific instructions

**Narrative**:

-   Describe what you learned in Lab 3. First, describe what you learned when working on the activity yourself. Then, review the [walkthrough videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYvyo-La3zBN8qoyCf3l0RRaopUa0KXPG) (if you haven't already) and describe any interesting differences between the walkthrough and your own work. Finally, summarize your overall takeaways from the whole lab.

-   Describe your experience with the fundamentals notebooks. How difficult are they? How long are they taking you? How are you collaborating, if applicable? (Consider notebook `009` separately, since we did it together in class and did a [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYvyo-La3zBOvTxiOhy4y6l65TxcUtCuS) also.) *If you need help with something, please ask on Piazza or Teams*.

-   How do you feel about our pace?

**Quantitative**: Compute grades for each item as follows.

-   For the reading, give scores for each item but choose your own weighting.

-   Lab 3: For "before reviewing", give a grade based on how prepared you were for the activity (from the reading) and how effective your problem-solving, collaboration, and help-seeking strategies were. For "after reviewing", give a grade based on how effectively you revised your understanding and your work based on reviewing the walkthrough, and your overall takeaways.

-   [**Portfolio**](https://classroom.github.com/a/t9EfXnfw) **Fundamentals**: Give 10 points for each Fundamentals notebook you have fully completed (since the start). Compute an overall grade as `sum(grades) / 100` (i.e., all 10 notebooks should be completed by now).

Compute an overall grade by averaging the component scores. Choose your own weighting, but justify it.

### Community: \_\_\_%

*This section is identical to Reflection 5.*

There are many different good ways to contribute to others' learning about AI (inside or outside this class), so I do not expect everyone to have done each of the following.

-   What Piazza post or reply of yours do you want to highlight and why? Include the URL. (If you posted anonymously and want to remain anonymous, just say "posted anonymously" or "replied anonymously").

-   What was a specific way that you helped a fellow student in lab/class/homework, or were helped by them?

-   What discussion post of yours do you want to highlight as an example of making another student feel heard or valued? Include a URL.

-   Beyond these, what else have you done to contribute to others' learning about AI since our class started? Please be specific.

Assign a grade out of 10 points for each of these four areas, then compute an overall grade as `10*max(grades)`. (i.e., something substantial in any of these areas suffices for full credit).

### Context / History: \_\_\_%

Our primary contextual engagement this week was about facial recognition. Describe how you engaged that (or another topic, if applicable). Be specific: include a link to your Moodle post/reply, or specify what you contributed to the in-class discussion.
