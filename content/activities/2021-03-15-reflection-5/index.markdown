*This assignment should be turned in on Moodle.*

This reflection is like Reflection 4, but focuses on what you've done since then.

You are, as always, welcome to make a compelling, argument for computing grades for yourself differently from this suggestion.

### Technology: \_\_\_%

Fill in the following list (specific instructions are below the list):

-   Chapter 5: \[\_\_%\] *comments*

-   Lab 2: \[\_\_%\] *comments*

-   Lab 3: \[\_\_%\] *comments*

-   Portfolio Fundamentals: \[\_\_%\]

#### Specific instructions

Compute grades for each item as follows, and replace the "*comments*" placeholders with a brief evidence (e.g., "I got through all but 2 or 3 of the code cells (link here)") and how you feel about it ("feel mostly confident, but can we talk more about `DataObjectClassWrapperThing` in section *XZY*?").

-   For chapter 5, consider your Active Reading notebook, since there was no reading quiz or check-in quiz here. If you didn't do one, you are welcome to make a different argument for how you engaged with and understood it.

-   **Lab 2**: Consider mostly the post-lab quiz. If you think you learned more (or less?) than the quiz grade suggests, argue so here.

-   [**Portfolio**](https://classroom.github.com/a/t9EfXnfw) **Fundamentals**: Consider notebooks starting at `003-pets-dataloader` (so one overlap with last week). Give 10 points for each Fundamentals notebook you have fully completed. Compute an overall grade as `min(100, sum(grades) * 100 / 30`. (i.e., completing three notebooks suffices for full credit).

**Quantitative:** Compute a grade for yourself based on the simple average of your scores for each activity. (You may use a different weighting if you make a good argument.)

**Narrative**: In addition to the brief inline comment,s write a brief response to these questions:

-   What is one thing that you feel you understand better this week than last week? What helped you?

-   What about chapters 4 and 5 are you least confident in? If you're able to, can you describe what you're struggling with?

-   How do you feel about our pace?

### Community: \_\_\_%

Again, there are many different good ways to contribute to others' learning about AI (inside or outside this class), so I do not expect everyone to have done each of the following.

-   What Piazza post or reply do you want to highlight and why? Include the URL. (If you posted anonymously and want to remain anonymous, just say "posted anonymously" or "replied anonymously").

-   What was a specific way that you helped a fellow student in lab/class/homework, or were helped by them?

-   What discussion post do you want to highlight as an example of making another student feel heard or valued? Include a URL.

-   Beyond these, what else have you done to contribute to others' learning about AI since our class started? Please be specific.

Assign a grade out of 10 points for each of these four areas, then compute an overall grade as `10*max(grades)`. (i.e., something substantial in any of these areas suffices for full credit).

### Context / History: \_\_\_%

From our discussion forums or class discussions: give full credit for any substantial engagement here. (Did you make any more post on a previous weeks' discussion forums? Did you post about any project ideas on this week's forum? etc.)
