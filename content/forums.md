## Week 2: Data

Congratulations on making it through the first week of classes in yet another unusual semester. We covered a lot of ground in the first week! Just look at the [objectives](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/22sp/units/01introduction/) to jog your memory.

### Wrapping up Week 1

- Make sure you've done all of the following (check them off in Moodle when you have)
  - **welcome survey**
  - **Python warm-up quiz**
  - **Preparation 1** (reading and quiz)
  - **Discussion 1**
  - And make sure you've logged onto **Piazza** (just click the link on Moodle).
- Homework 1 is to finish Lab 1.
  - We encountered some difficulty with the Image Classifier part because of a bug in a library we're using. See the "Hotfix" instructions in the [lab description](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/22sp/units/01introduction/lab/) for what to do about this.
    - Even if it worked for you, still check for the temp folder.
  - We'll allow some of the time in Monday's lab to wrap up the Image Classifier part of Lab 1.
  - If you want to work on your own time, you can come into the lab; everything should work over Guacamole too, though availability is limited.
  - I've bumped the due date to Tuesday.
- We will not have a Reflection or Project Milestone for this week.

### Preparing for Week 2

In week 2 we will start considering what *data* you need to train models. You'll collect some image data yourself and train and evaluate a model. We'll also start looking at some of the ethics of collecting data for AI; we will return to this discussion throughout the semester.

- On **Monday** we will do Lab 2 (with a bit of time to finish the part of Lab 1 that is highly related), where we'll try out some variations on the image classifier and also look a bit at the data it's using.
  - Please read Chapter 2 and some of Chapter 3 in preparation. See Moodle for a reading quiz.
- On **Wednesday** we'll review what we've been studying in a lecture format.
- On **Friday** we'll wrap up what we didn't get to on Wednesday, planning to leave time to work on Homework 2 (training a classifier on your own images).

I’m here for you. We’re all here for each other. May our Lord give us all strength to persevere, joy in the journey, and love for each other along the way.
