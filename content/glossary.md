## Error Rate

- Fraction of results that were incorrect. i.e., number of wrong results divided by total number of images used to evaluate.
- Also known as "zero-one loss" (because you're penalized 1 point for every incorrect answer, no partial credit).
- *accuracy* = 1 - error rate

## Epoch

- One pass through the training set
- Generally you'll need several epochs to reach good performance.
- The book and course materials use 1 in some cases where the task is relatively easy or just to make the computation take less time.
