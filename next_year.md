# Next Year

## High level

* Start with applications. Gradually deepen the code and concepts.
* Intentionally overlap application areas and even specific datasets between DATA 202 and CS 344.
* The material on interpretability and fairness/bias could have come much earlier.

## Materials

* The fast.ait textbook doesnâ€™t encourage enough spending time with data (EDA)


## Logistics

* Don't bother auto-pushing content to student repos.
* Use a single platform (Colab?)

## Potential Resources

* [Applied Machine Learning course at Cornell Tech](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UML_KCiC0UlY7iCQDSiGDMovaupqc83)
