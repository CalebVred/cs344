# Next Year

## High level

* Start with applications. Gradually deepen the code and concepts.
* Intentionally overlap application areas and even specific datasets between DATA 202 and CS 344.
* The material on interpretability and fairness/bias could have come much earlier in the semester.
* Remind students about the drivetrain approach for projects

## Materials

* The fast.ai textbook doesn’t encourage enough spending time with data (EDA)


## Logistics

* Don't bother auto-pushing content to student repos.
* Use a single compute platform (Colab?)
* Use a single submission platform (Moodle?)


## Potential Resources

* [Applied Machine Learning course at Cornell Tech](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2UML_KCiC0UlY7iCQDSiGDMovaupqc83)

## Potential Activities

* Logistic regression in NN (as same thing as linreg, just different loss and activation)
* Vision to text encoder decoder—with paraphrase setup both ways
