===02/03/2021
Topic:: Kickoff, Teachable Machine, Logistics
Prep:: read Syllabus
Resources:: [Day 1 slides](/slides/w1d1/w1d1-intro.html)

Log::
  * 15+ min: think-pair-share about intelligence in Scripture (Psalm 103 example)
  * 5 min: bare minimum logistics
  * 15 min: Teachable Machine in partners
  * 5 min: debrief Teachable Machine
  * 5 min: objectives and send-off

Reflection::
  * People got talking with each other.
  * People reflected on God's word and what it means for our class, in a way that
    will give persective to the rest of our time together.
  * People got experience with machine learning and data collection.

  It wasn't perfect, but it was the right way to start the semester.

Next time::
  * Shorter Scripture passage
  * Frame the Scripture TPS with an example?
  * Maybe have a backup device in case Teachable Machine doesn't work for someone?

===02/04/2021
Quiz:: Python review

  * Boolean function: does this string start with a capital letter?
  * func returning a string: strip everything after (and including) the last underscore
  * do this for every string in a list, without rewriting the logic
  * return the sum of the square of every element in a list

  ```
  x = 'grizzly', 'white', 'teddy'
  a,b,c = x
  print(c)
  ```

  ```
  class Thing:
    def __getitem__(self, x): return f"Item {x}"
    def __getattr__(self, x): return f"Attr {x}"

  # explain the result of each of the following lines.
  y = Thing
  y.abc
  y['abc']
  z = y()
  z.abc
  z['abc']
  z[abc]
  ```

  Suppose you have `def do_to_all(x, f): return [f(o) for o in x]`

  Fill in the blank:

  ```
  paths = ['a_b1', 'b_c2']
  stripped_paths = do_to_all(paths, _____)
  print(paths)
  ```

  So that you get ['a', 'b']. Explain why this works.

Topic:: Lab 0: Warm-up

Notes::
  <details><summary>Lab Logistics</summary>

  * Come to Maroon lab. Fill in computers as available, others stand around the sides of
    the room (at safe distance) for overview (then move to Gold lab)
  * People at Maroon lab computers: **reboot into Linux**

  </details>

===
Topic:: Lab 1 (Chapter 1)

Prep::
  * read [DL4C chapter 1](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb)
  * Watch [Lesson 1 Video](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)
  * Complete reading quiz


Notes::


Next Time::
  * Simplify the questions.
  * Give some guidance on logistics (remind Lab 0: github, Maroon lab not VMs, full-screen trick)
  * Have students make some observations about individual images.
