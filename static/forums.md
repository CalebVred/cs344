## Week 4 Thursday

As discussed in class yesterday, the **portfolio repos are now live. Claim yours [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/t9EfXnfw)** (link is also on the class calendar). To start, go in "fundamentals", read the README, and get started soon; first few that are already up there should be pretty easy. I'll push new notebooks every few days.

Also, a reminder since we'd skipped a few weeks: this week's [**check-in quiz**](https://https//moodle.calvin.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1208066) **has been posted**.

Finally, to reduce the variance in reflection grades, the next reflection will have a more objective rubric. Since it will require referring to the portfolio and quiz (as well as the hw1 revision), I'm **delaying the due date for the reflection** until next Wednesday (i.e., we're skipping a week for reflections).

(Sorry for the midweek updates this week; I aim for these to be once a week.)

## Week 4

Happy Saturday everyone! As I mentioned in class, I'm sorry I'm so behind in giving you feedback, and I'm sorry for not posting a check-in quiz in the usual time this week (I'll post one by Monday, which you can attempt whenever works for you).

**Where we are**: We started off treating everything as a black box (that block of code that fit the pet classifier) and we've been gradually peeling off layers of the onion:

-   First we explored *data*: how do we get data, in a useful form? How does the data affect what the model learns?

-   Now we're exploring the model's *outputs*: how do we measure what makes a good output, and how do we get the model to update itself to make its output better?

-   After this we'll peel off the covers on the model itself.

As we get into more technical depth, some people may find the material harder. Others may actually find this easier for various reasons, though. So help each other! -- ask questions, post hints, etc.

**This week**:

-   **Prep**:

    -   All of the Lesson 3 video and part of Chapter 4; see the Calendar and Reading Quiz for details.

    -   Also, start reading the [Facial Recognition discussion](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/ka37/activities/discussion-2-facial-recognition/) readings.

    -   Sometime this week, try to revise your Homework 1 in light of our discussions, both about decisions/data/experimentation/variation and about `DataLoader`s.

-   **Monday**: We'll be back in classroom, reviewing some of the reading together. Have your active reading notebooks handy and come with your questions.

-   **Wednesday**:

    -   We'll overflow from Monday as needed, then discuss some highlights from the facial recognition discussion.

    -   Another reflection due. Keep it brief, but do try to discuss your HW1 revision.

-   **Friday**: Lab (in the classroom space) on fitting models with gradient descent. If you're able to finish Chapter 4 reading by then, it'll be helpful; otherwise get it over the weekend.

## Week 3

Happy Saturday everyone! I'm enjoying reading your reflections and feedback about the class. I'm hearing from many people that they'd like some more discussion about technical concepts than they're getting from the reading and videos. In light of that, I'm making a few tweaks: this week we'll do a **lecture on Monday** instead of a lab.

In case you missed it, the reading assignment for this weekend is to **finish Chapter 3**. There's a [reading quiz](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1203438) on Moodle as usual. Depending on your comfort, you may choose to answer the questions there in **this week's [discussion forum](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1203582)** instead.

Speaking of which, [last week's discussion forum](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1200372) was a lot of fun---I may have spent too much time responding to your posts! But only a few people posted any replies. So this week I'll encourage you to **reply to other students**.

Also, thanks to someone asking, I realized I'd forgotten to link to my **office hours** calendar. I added that on the syllabus. You can always message me directly. I'll probably ask you to post about our discussion on Piazza too, because they're usually good questions that others would benefit from hearing too.

This week's deadlines (all informal except the reflections, as usual, but the reflections should mention all of them):

-   **Monday**:

    -   Reading Quiz 3

    -   Homework 1 (we'll discuss some in class tomorrow)

-   **Wednesday**:

    -   Reflection 3.

    -   Reply in Week 2 Discussion Forum

-   **Thursday**: Quiz 4 (I'll try to post this early so you can reference it in the Reflection, but no promises.)

-   **Friday**:

    -   Post in Week 3 discussion.

    -   I recommend getting started on Chapter 4 because it's more technical than the first few

-   **next Monday**: Reading Quiz 4 (on chapter 4).
