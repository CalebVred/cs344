## Week 3

Happy Saturday everyone! I'm enjoying reading your reflections and feedback about the class. I'm hearing from many people that they'd like some more discussion about technical concepts than they're getting from the reading and videos. In light of that, I'm making a few tweaks: this week we'll do a **lecture on Monday** instead of a lab.

In case you missed it, the reading assignment for this weekend is to **finish Chapter 3**. There's a [reading quiz](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1203438) on Moodle as usual. Depending on your comfort, you may choose to answer the questions there in **this week's [discussion forum](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1203582)** instead.

Speaking of which, [last week's discussion forum](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1200372) was a lot of fun---I may have spent too much time responding to your posts! But only a few people posted any replies. So this week I'll encourage you to **reply to other students**.

Also, thanks to someone asking, I realized I'd forgotten to link to my **office hours** calendar. I added that on the syllabus. You can always message me directly. I'll probably ask you to post about our discussion on Piazza too, because they're usually good questions that others would benefit from hearing too.

This week's deadlines (all informal except the reflections, as usual, but the reflections should mention all of them):

-   **Monday**:

    -   Reading Quiz 3

    -   Homework 1 (we'll discuss some in class tomorrow)

-   **Wednesday**:

    -   Reflection 3.

    -   Reply in Week 2 Discussion Forum

-   **Thursday**: Quiz 4 (I'll try to post this early so you can reference it in the Reflection, but no promises.)

-   **Friday**:

    -   Post in Week 3 discussion.

    -   I recommend getting started on Chapter 4 because it's more technical than the first few

-   **next Monday**: Reading Quiz 4 (on chapter 4).
