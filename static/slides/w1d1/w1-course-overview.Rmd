## What is this course?

This is a course on developing AI systems using machine learning, with a particular emphasis on deep neural networks.

### Objectives

By the end of this course, you will demonstrate growth in your ability to:

- Design a machine learning system to address a given challenge.
- Implement machine learning systems using both high-level and low-level programming interfaces.
- Critically analyze the use and misuse of AI and ML techniques in situations affecting people
- Describe the history and trajectory of artificial intelligence

---

## Real objective

.center[
**You graduate and do amazing work in AI.**
]

So, you should be:

* self-directed, collaborative learners
* able to be immediately productive at some kinds of ML problems
* in the habit of practicing the integrity and perseverance needed to work in a team

---

## Approach

- Hands-on: lots of programming and analysis.
- Typically one "lecture" meeting per week, two lab days
- Reading and watching videos outside of class is expected. Make time for it.

---

## Sequence

- First 6 or 7 weeks: fundamentals of machine learning
  - Top-down: image classification using convolutional neural nets
  - Bottom-up: array computing, elements of neural network modeling, learning by gradient descent
- Then: repeat using language processing and Transformers models
- Finally: applications and other topics (human-AI interaction, reinforcement learning, engineering and deployment considerations, ...)
- Discussions on applications, ethics and social impact, and Christian perspectives throughout

Why the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/)?

- Past students of the fastai course have published original research and won competitions
- Based on PyTorch (a close competitor to TensorFlow, popular in academic research)
- Custom [software library](https://docs.fast.ai/) adds a [layered API](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/2/108/htm) to speed up development
- Jupyter Notebooks: you can run everything yourself

## Why not just learn this on your own?

This course gives you:

* Structure
* An instructor
* Peers
* Freedom to ask stupid questions

---

## Structure

We will vary our pace depending on students' needs, but the structure will be predictable:

* **Weekend**: read (actively!) a textbook chapter, watch a video lecture
* **Monday Lab**: apply what you've just read, extend it slightly
* **Tuesday**: write your weekly learning reflection, contribute to discussion forums
* **Wednesday Discussion** (in classroom): debrief lab, discuss perspectives
* **Thursday**: take a content quiz (most weeks, not this week)
* **Friday Lab**: work on homework / project; micro-lectures as needed


---

## Who am I?

* Husband, father of two 4-year-old girls
* Natural Language Processing + Human-Computer Interaction

---

## Peers

Your peers provide:

* **Collaborators**. You'll be able to do great projects together.
* **Learning community**. I may be one of your last official teachers. But you must keep learning.
* **Discussion partners**. Your peers bring valuable perspectives.
* **Practice analyzing other people's work**. It will be most of what you do. So we must practice it. We will do some peer feedback during our time together.

---

## "I don't know"

* Say this often.
* I will too.
* Ask questions on Piazza.
* When you've figured it out, communicate (e.g., a blog)

---

## Weekly Reflections

- Goal: *meta*cognition: awareness of what you know and don't.
- weekly short writeup highlighting two pieces of work:
  1. something that shows you've achieved the week's learning objectives (typically lab / homework)
  2. something you've revised from a previous week, and how it's improved.
- Simple grading system:
  - Effort: credit for timely submission (don't get behind!)
  - Mastery: simple grades for the items highlighted in reflections

details in syllabus.

---

## Projects

- Midterm project: analyze and partially replicate an existing machine learning result (paper, blog post, Kaggle competition, etc.)
- Final project: do new work
