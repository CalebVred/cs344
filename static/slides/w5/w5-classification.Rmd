## Logistics

- Reflection and Homework due tomorrow

---

## Interesting Points from Discussion?

- Share with neighbors.
- Then we'll share with everyone.

---

## How to classify?

- How do we measure how good a classifier is?
- How do we turn scores into probabilities?

---

## Elo

A measure of relative skill:

- Higher Elo more likely to win
- Greater point spread -> more confidence in win

- Uses: [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), [NFL](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/)
- 538's [Superbowl prediction](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/games/) 
([discussion](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rams-or-bengals-our-guide-to-super-bowl-lvi/))

## How do we measure how good a classifier is?

Cross Entropy: should give high probability to correct result.

---

## How do we turn scores into probabilities?

---

## Where do the "right" scores come from?

- In linear regression we were given the right scores.
- In classification, we have to learn the scores from data.
