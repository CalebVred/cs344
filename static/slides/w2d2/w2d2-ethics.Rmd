## The Metropolis algorithm

Goal (for most ML applications): run a generative model backwards.
.pull-left[
* You have observations
* You propose a theory: a program that generates those observations
* But the program depends on unknown constants
* You need: good values of those constants
]

.pull-right[
* documents (collections of words)
* generate documents by sampling words from topics
* which words are in which topics?
* algorithm: Latent Dirichlet Allocation
]

(Imagine running your image classifier backwards: tell it "dog" and it should generate an image of a dog.)

> Instead of choosing configurations randomly, then weighting them with exp(−E/kT), we choose configurations with a probability exp(−E/kT) and weight them evenly.

## AI Ethics Examples 

(We'll do this in the class OneNote)

## Aspects of AI that affect ethics

* AI needs data (privacy)
  * ...and empowers organizations that aggregate data
* AI needs lots of computation
* AI's outputs affect people
  * predictions and decisions (bias, discrimination, gig labor, ...)
  * how we perceive each other (and ourselves)
  * how we perceive ideas (misinformation)
* AI does things that people once did
* AI systems can be attacked in new ways
* AI embeds values about what is human
* AI tells us about our own intelligence
