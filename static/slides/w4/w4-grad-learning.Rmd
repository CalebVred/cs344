## Monday Lab Recap

Explain to your neighbor what we did on Monday.

--

How does Monday lab compare with linear regression that you've seen before?


---

## Model = architecture + loss + data + optimization

---

## Linear Regression

---

## Bias (Intercept)

---

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

We only need a few points to find a descent direction

---

## Computing that gradient
